# ihsmarkit

To run this file, please open this file in a computer that has installed JavaSDK and library support. Using any IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse would work for this.

```
git clone https://github.com/jeremyxie712/ihsmarkit.git
```
You would need an IDE to run this project, a read-only editor would not work for this file. For reference, I personally used IntelliJ IDEA while writing this project. To continue testing, open the project in your selected IDE and right click on the *.java* file, click 'Run'/'Run ihsmarkitAssignment.main()'. I have written two options for testing. 

```
1 : Inputting 1 onto the console, the code will automatically use the string inside the file for testing. I have only written one input for demonstration only. 

2 : Inputting 2 onto the console, the code will ask user to keyboard input any string of users' choice, the code is able to handle empty strings or any other kind of strings. 
```
